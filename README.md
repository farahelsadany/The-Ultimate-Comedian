# The-Ultimate-Comedian
The Ultimate Comedian — Python, Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA-3.2-B Instruct, Unsloth, PyTorch
Aug 2025

- Scraped and cleaned 470+ stand-up comedy transcripts from Scraps From the Loft, curating a domain-specific dataset of jokes, punchlines, and comedic delivery.

- Generated 30k+ synthetic prompt–answer pairs with GPT-4o-mini, augmenting real transcripts to expand coverage of diverse humor styles and comedic contexts.

- Fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2-1B Instruct using Unsloth and PyTorch, optimizing for comedic timing, audience engagement, and natural delivery.

I’ve uploaded the dataset I generated — around 470+ transcripts from 200+ comedians. Based on audience reactions, I prompted GPT-4o-mini to generate QA pairs.

I see a lot of potential for this dataset to become a solid comedy reference by using LLMs and improving it further: diversifying prompts, making answers more contextual, and more.

I also included a simple Jupyter notebook I wrote to web-scrape and curate the data.
